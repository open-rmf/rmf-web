## RoMi-dashboard

Hello! `romi-dashboard` is a web application that provides overall visualization and control over the RoMi system.

## Setup

Install `npm` and `nodejs`,

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install nodejs
```

Clone the repository and install the required packages,

```bash
cd ~/.
git clone https://github.com/osrf/romi-dashboard
cd romi-dashboard
npm install
```

### (Optional) Import external resources.

```bash
npm run setup
```

When executing this command, a prompt will be displayed, and it will guide you through the process.

You have two options, import a specific folder with assets from a repository (like Github) or copy the assets folder from a local directory.

In the case of choosing to obtain the data from a repository, you must define: (1) The repository URL and (2) the folder within the repository. In case of choosing to obtain the data from a local directory, the absolute path must be defined.

This folder obtained must contain at its root a JSON file calling `main.json`, with the _RomiDashboard_ actors (robots, dispensers, etc.) and the path to their corresponding resources. E.g.:

```json
{
  "robots":
    "tinyRobot" <fleet>: {
      "icons": {
        "tinyRobot"<fleet>: "/robots/tinyRobot/tinyRobot.png",
        "model1"<model>: "/robots/tinyRobot/model1.png"
      }
    }
}
```

Obs: the algorithm will check the robot's icons in this order:

1. Icon exists for a model; if not exists
2. Icon exists for a fleet; if not exists
3. It will use a default icon.

Upon completion of the configuration, a file called .resources.json will be created automatically, which will save the configuration from where to obtain the resources.

In case you want to modify the source of your resources. You can rerun the command:

```bash
npm run setup
```

## Launching

### Local Dev Server

_RoMi-dashboard_ gets its data source from the following rmf components:

- [rmf schedule visualizer](https://github.com/osrf/rmf_schedule_visualizer)
- [soss](https://github.com/osrf/soss)
- [rmf-soss-ros2](https://github.com/osrf/rmf-soss-ros2)
- [rmf_demos](https://github.com/osrf/rmf_demos)

Refer to the respective projects for instruction on how to setup them up.

You would also need [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for the authentication server.

The easiest way to launch a local server for development is with

```bash
npm start
```

This will start all the necessary backends, a browser window should open up pointing to the local dev server. When prompted with an user/password, use this:

```
user: admin
password: admin
```

### External Server

Alternatively, if you want to connect to an existing rmf deployment, set the following environment variables:

- _REACT_APP_SOSS_SERVER_: URL to the soss server.
- _REACT_APP_TRAJECTORY_SERVER_: URL to the trajectory server.
- _REACT_APP_AUTH_CONFIG_: A JSON object containing the following
  - _realm_: The keycloak realm
  - _clientId_: clientId
  - _url_: URL to the keycloak server

Then start the web server with

```bash
npm run start:react
```

### Mock Data

If you are just working on the frontend, you can launch _RoMi-dashboard_ with a set of mock data, this does not require any rmf deployments, simply run

```bash
npm run start:mock
```

To bring up a web server using mock data.

### Storybook

Another way to work on the frontend without rmf is with [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), simply run

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This is ideal if you are working on individual isolated components.

## Building for production

Firstly, set up environment variables according to [this](#External-Server), you may also want to install a resource pack as described [here](#Optional-Import-external-resources.). Then build a production version of _RoMi-dashboard_ with

```bash
npm run build
```

You can then serve the `build` directory using the webserver of your choice.
