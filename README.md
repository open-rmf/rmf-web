# RMF Web

![](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf-web/blob/media/dashboard_office_world.gif)

Open-RMF Web is a collection of packages that provide a web-based interface for users to visualize and control all aspects of Open-RMF deployments.

# Getting started

### Prerequisites

We currently support [Ubuntu 22.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/), [ROS 2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) and Open-RMF's [22.09](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf/releases/tag/22.09) release. Other distributions may work as well, but is not guaranteed.

Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) >= 16,
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash
nvm install 16
```

Install pnpm and nodejs
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | bash -
pnpm env use --global 16
```

Install pipenv
```bash
pip3 install pipenv
```

For Debian/Ubuntu systems, you may need to install `python3-venv` first.
```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv
```

### Installing Open-RMF

Refer to the following documentation for either building from source or installing released binaries:

* [rmf](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf)

> **Note**
> Simulation demos are not part of the released binaries, and therefore a built workspace with at least the [demos repository](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_demos) would be required for trying out the web dashboard with simulation.

### Install dependencies

Run
```bash
pnpm install
```

You may also install dependencies for only a subset of the packages
```bash
pnpm install -w --filter <package>...
```

### Launching

Source Open-RMF and launch the dashboard in development mode,
```bash
# For binary installation
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

# For source build
source /path/to/workspace/install/setup.bash

cd packages/dashboard
pnpm start
```

This starts up the API server (by default at port 8000) which sets up endpoints to communicate with an Open-RMF deployment, as well as begin compilation of the dashboard. Once completed, it can be viewed at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

If presented with a login screen, use `user=admin password=admin`.

Ensure that the fleet adapters in the Open-RMF deployment is configured to use the endpoints of the API server. By default it is `http://localhost:8000/_internal`. Launching a simulation from `rmf_demos_gz` for example, the command would be,

```bash
ros2 launch rmf_demos_gz office.launch.xml server_uri:="http://localhost:8000/_internal"
```

### Optimized build

The dashboard can also be built statically for better performance.

```bash
cd packages/dashboard
pnpm run build

# Once completed
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

This only serves the frontend, the API server can be started manually to work with an Open-RMF deployment on another terminal instance,

```bash
# source Open-RMF before proceeding
cd packages/api-server
pnpm start
```

# Contribution guide

* For general contribution guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Follow [typescript guidelines](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/styleguide).
* When introducing a new feature or component in [`react-components`](packages/react-components), write tests and stories.
* When introducing a new feature in [`dashboard`](packages/dashboard), write tests as well as [e2e](packages/dashboard-e2e) test whenever possible.
* When introducing API changes with [`api-server`](packages/api-server),
  * If the new changes are to be used externally (outside of the web packages, with other Open-RMF packages for example), make changes to [`rmf_api_msgs`](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_api_msgs), before generating the required models using [this script](packages/api-server/generate-models.sh) with modified commit hashes.
  * Don't forget to update the API client with the newly added changes with [these instructions](packages/api-client/README.md/#generating-rest-api-client).
* Check out the latest API definitions [here](https://open-rmf.github.io/rmf-web/docs/api-server), or visit `/docs` relative to your running server's url, e.g. `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
* Develop the frontend without launching any Open-RMF components using [storybook](packages/dashboard/README.md/#storybook).

# Configuration

See the [rmf-dashboard](packages/dashboard/README.md#configuration) docs.

# Troubleshooting

* If a feature is missing or is not working, it could be only available in an Open-RMF source build, and not in the binaries. Try building Open-RMF from source and source that new workspace before launching the API server. `rmf-web` may use in-development features of Open-RMF.

* Creating tasks from the web dashboard when running a simulated Open-RMF deployment will require the task start time suit simulation time, which starts from unix millis 0. Try creating the same task with a start date of before the year of 1970.

* Check if the issue has already been [reported or fixed](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf-web/issues).
