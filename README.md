# RMF Web

![](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf-web/blob/media/dashboard1.0-office-world.gif)

Open-RMF Web is a collection of packages that provide a web-based interface for users to visualize and control all aspects of Open-RMF deployments.

# Quick start with docker

These docker images are useful when trying out [`rmf_demos`](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_demos).

Start the dashboard with host network access, `RMF_SERVER_URL` and `TRAJECTORY_SERVER_URL` configured accordingly. The dashboard will then accessible on `localhost:3000` by default.

```bash
docker run \
  --network host -it --rm \
  -e RMF_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8000 \
  -e TRAJECTORY_SERVER_URL=ws://localhost:8006 \
  ghcr.io/open-rmf/rmf-web/dashboard:latest
```

> **Note**
> The values provided for `RMF_SERVER_URL` and `TRAJECTORY_SERVER_URL` are default values when running the API server and `rmf_demos`, and can be modified to suit different setups.

Start the API server with host network access, and set up the correct `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` and ROS 2 RMW implementation that will be used in the rest of the Open-RMF system. The API server will use the default port at `localhost:8000`.

```bash
docker run \
  --network host -it --rm \
  -e ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<ROS_DOMAIN_ID> \
  -e RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=<RMW_IMPLEMENTATION> \
  ghcr.io/open-rmf/rmf-web/api-server:latest
```

> **Note**
> Users can also [configure the API server](packages/api-server/README.md/#configuration) using a mounted configuration file and setting the environment variable `RMF_API_SERVER_CONFIG`. In the default scenario, the API server will use an internal non-persistent database.

# Getting started from source

### Prerequisites

We currently support [Ubuntu 24.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/noble/), [ROS 2 Jazzy](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/index.html) and Open-RMF's [22.09](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf/releases/tag/22.09) release. Other distributions may work as well, but is not guaranteed.

Install pnpm and nodejs

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | bash -
pnpm env use --global lts
```

For Debian/Ubuntu systems,

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv
```

### Installing Open-RMF

Refer to the following documentation for either building from source or installing released binaries:

- [rmf](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf)

> **Note**
> Simulation demos are not part of the released binaries, and therefore a built workspace with at least the [demos repository](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_demos) would be required for trying out the web dashboard with simulation.

### Install dependencies

Run

```bash
pnpm install
```

You may also install dependencies for only a subset of the packages

```bash
pnpm install -w --filter <package>...
```

### Launching for development

Source Open-RMF and launch the dashboard in development mode,

```bash
# For binary installation
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash

# For source build
source /path/to/workspace/install/setup.bash

cd packages/dashboard
pnpm start
```

This starts up the API server (by default at port 8000) which sets up endpoints to communicate with an Open-RMF deployment, as well as begin compilation of the dashboard. Once completed, it can be viewed at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

If presented with a login screen, use `user=admin password=admin`.

Ensure that the fleet adapters in the Open-RMF deployment is configured to use the endpoints of the API server. By default it is `http://localhost:8000/_internal`. Launching a simulation from [`rmf_demos_gz`](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_demos) for example, the command would be,

```bash
ros2 launch rmf_demos_gz office.launch.xml server_uri:="http://localhost:8000/_internal"
```

### Launching for development separately

When developing individual components, it may be useful to start the dashboard and api-server separately,

```bash
# Start the dashboard in dev, this monitors for changes in the dashboard package and performs rebuilds. A browser refresh is required after all automated builds.
cd packages/dashboard
pnpm run start:react

# Start the API server, this will need to be restarted for any changes to be reflected
cd packages/api-server
pnpm run start
```

### Optimized build

The dashboard can also be built statically for better performance.

```bash
cd packages/dashboard
pnpm run build

# Once completed
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

This only serves the frontend, the API server can be started manually to work with an Open-RMF deployment on another terminal instance,

```bash
# source Open-RMF before proceeding
cd packages/api-server
pnpm run start
```

# Contribution guide

- For general contribution guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Follow [typescript guidelines](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/styleguide).
- When introducing a new feature or component in [`react-components`](packages/react-components), write tests and stories.
- When introducing a new feature in [`dashboard`](packages/dashboard), write tests as well as [e2e](packages/dashboard-e2e) test whenever possible.
- When introducing API changes with [`api-server`](packages/api-server),
  - If the new changes are to be used externally (outside of the web packages, with other Open-RMF packages for example), make changes to [`rmf_api_msgs`](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_api_msgs), before generating the required models using [this script](packages/api-server/generate-models.sh) with modified commit hashes.
  - Don't forget to update the API client with the newly added changes with [these instructions](packages/api-client/README.md/#generating-rest-api-client).
- Check out the latest API definitions [here](https://open-rmf.github.io/rmf-web/), or visit `/docs` relative to your running server's url, e.g. `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
- Develop the frontend without launching any Open-RMF components using [storybook](packages/dashboard/README.md/#storybook).
- For integration with new devices/infrastructure, check out [Robot Interaction Objects (RIO)](<https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf-web/wiki/Robot-Interaction-Objects-(RIO)>).
- Update documentation alongside development, and update the [`ros2multirobotbook`](https://osrf.github.io/ros2multirobotbook) where necessary.

# Configuration

- See the [rmf-dashboard](packages/dashboard/README.md#configuration) docs for the frontend build-time and run-time configurations.
- See the [api-server](packages/api-server/README.md#configuration) docs for API server run-time configurations.

# Troubleshooting

- If a feature is missing or is not working, it could be only available in an Open-RMF source build, and not in the binaries. Try building Open-RMF from source and source that new workspace before launching the API server. `rmf-web` may use in-development features of Open-RMF.

- Creating tasks from the web dashboard when running a simulated Open-RMF deployment will require the task start time suit simulation time, which starts from unix millis 0. Try creating the same task with a start date of before the year of 1970.

- Check if the issue has already been [reported or fixed](https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf-web/issues).
