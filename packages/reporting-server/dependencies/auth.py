    # TODO: Authorization code flow doesn't actually work because of this bug https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/6741.
    # althrough fastapi uses the latest version of swagger ui from a cdn,
    # the oauth2-redirect is hardcoded using an old version.
    #
    # Also, password flow may not work because it is not actually part of the oidc standard.
    # For keycloak, it doesn't return the id_token, which is required in a typical authorization code
    # flow.
    #
    # On top of the above problems, swagger ui doesn't actually fully support oidc in the
    # way we use it. We expect the id_token because it is the only token that MUST be a
    # JWT according to oidc spec (although most implementation nowadays also uses JWT
    # for the access token). Swagger UI passes the access_token to the server instead of the
    # id_token, so in the case that the authentication provider is not using a JWT for the
    # access_token, the authentication will fail. Even if the provider uses JWT for access_token,
    # it may still fail because of the different claims present in the access_token and id_token.
    # In the oidc spec, for an id_token, the "aud" claim MUST contain the client_id, but in
    # the case of keycloak, even though the access_token is also a JWT, it does not have to
    # follow the id_token spec, so the "aud" claim MAY NOT contain the client_id.
    # This causes authentication to fail because in the JWT spec, if the "aud" claim is present,
    # the verifier MUST check that it contains an expected value, since we expect an oidc
    # id_token, we MUST verify that the "aud" contains the client_id.
