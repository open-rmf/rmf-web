## RoMi-dashboard

Hello! `romi-dashboard` is a web application that provides overall visualization and control over the RoMi system.

## Setup

Prerequisites:

* nodejs == v12
* docker
* docker-compose
* [rmf_core](https://github.com/osrf/rmf_core)
* [traffic_editor](https://github.com/osrf/traffic_editor)
* [rmf_schedule_visualizer](https://github.com/osrf/rmf_schedule_visualizer)
* [rmf_demos](https://github.com/osrf/rmf_demos)

Refer to the various repository for instructions to set them up.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/osrf/rmf-web
cd rmf-web
npm run bootstrap
```

### (Optional) Import external resources.

```bash
npm run setup
```

When executing this command, a prompt will be displayed, and it will guide you through the process.

You have two options, import a specific folder with assets from a repository (like Github) or copy the assets folder from a local directory.

In the case of choosing to obtain the data from a repository, you must define: (1) The repository URL and (2) the folder within the repository. In case of choosing to obtain the data from a local directory, the absolute path must be defined.

This folder obtained must contain at its root a JSON file calling `main.json`, with the _RomiDashboard_ actors (robots, dispensers, etc.) and the path to their corresponding resources. E.g.:

```json
{
  "robots":
    "tinyRobot" <fleet>: {
      "icons": {
        "tinyRobot"<fleet>: "/robots/tinyRobot/tinyRobot.png",
        "model1"<model>: "/robots/tinyRobot/model1.png"
      }
    }
}
```

Obs: the algorithm will check the robot's icons in this order:

1. Icon exists for a model; if not exists
2. Icon exists for a fleet; if not exists
3. It will use a default icon.

Upon completion of the configuration, a file called .resources.json will be created automatically, which will save the configuration from where to obtain the resources.

In case you want to modify the source of your resources. You can rerun the command:

```bash
npm run setup
```

## Launching

### Local Dev Server

```bash
npm start
```

This will start all the necessary backends, a browser window should open up pointing to the local dev server. When prompted with an user/password, use this:

```
user: admin
password: admin
```

### External Server

Alternatively, if you want to connect to an existing rmf deployment, set the following environment variables:

* _REACT_APP_BASE_PATH_: Base path that the app is hosted. Defaults to '/'.
* _REACT_APP_TRAJECTORY_SERVER_: **Required** URL to the trajectory server.
* _REACT_APP_ROS2_BRIDGE_SERVER_: **Required** URL to the ros2 bridge server.
* _REACT_APP_AUTH_CONFIG_: **Required** A JSON object containing the following
  * _realm_: The keycloak realm
  * _clientId_: clientId
  * _url_: URL to the keycloak server

Then start the web server with

```bash
npm run start:react
```

### Storybook

**Many of the components are reused from `react-components`, you may want to run storybook on `react-components` instead.**

Another way to work on the frontend without rmf is with [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), simply run

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This is ideal if you are working on individual isolated components.

### Mock Data **(not recommended)**

**This does not emulated robots, tasks, trajectories, deliveries, charging etc, running the dashboard with mock data is no longer a good "preview" of the actual dashboard.**

If you are just working on the frontend, you can launch _RoMi-dashboard_ with a set of mock data, this does not require any rmf deployments, simply run

```bash
npm run start:mock
```

To bring up a web server using mock data.

### Docker Based Backend **(not recommended)**

**This will cause the dashboard to be ran as root, side effects include tainting file ownership and permissions, breaking npm commands etc. If an isolated environment is required, it is recommended to instead use a VM or move the whole dev environment into docker (note that you would have to handle gpu, x11/wayland, nested docker, permissions, persistent storage etc support yourself, only do this if you understand what you are doing)**

If you have problem setting up rmf, you can make use of the docker image used by the e2e tests to run the backend in docker.

First, download the docker images, the images are hosted on github packages so you will need a github account to access it, refer to [here](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-docker-for-use-with-github-packages) for instructions.

After you have the credentials set up, run this to download the images

```bash
npm run sync:docker
```

Then run this to start the dev services

```bash
npm run start:docker
```

This will start all the services in a docker container, the react web app will be hosted at `localhost:3000`.

The rmf image is built nightly, if you would like to test against the latest build, be sure to update the docker images regularly.

#### Building Docker Images Locally

If you would like, you can also build the images locally, doing so is simple with

```bash
# build rmf image
docker-compose -f <path-to-romi-dashboard>/packages/dashboard/docker/rmf/docker-compose.yml build --no-cache
# build e2e image
docker-compose -f <path-to-romi-dashboard>/packages/dashboard/docker/docker-compose.yml build --no-cache e2e
```

This will download and build all of rmf so it may take awhile.

## Building for production

Firstly, set up environment variables according to [this](#External-Server), you may also want to install a resource pack as described [here](#Optional-Import-external-resources.). Then build a production version of _RoMi-dashboard_ with

```bash
npm run build
```

You can then serve the `build` directory using the webserver of your choice.
