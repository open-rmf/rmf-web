# # CONVENTIONS
# # ===========
# # single hinge doors:
# #   * hinge is located at (v1_x, v1_y)
# #   * door extends till (v2_x, v2_y)
# #   * motion_range = door swing range in DEGREES
# #   * there are two possible motions: clockwise and anti-clockwise
# #     selected by the motion_direction parameter, which is +1 or -1
# #
# # double hinge doors:
# #   * hinges are located at both (v1_x, v1_y) and (v2_x, v2_y)
# #   * motion range = door swing ranges in DEGREES (assume symmetric)
# #   * same motion-direction selection as single hinge
# #
# # single sliding doors:
# #   * the door slides from (v2_x, v2_y) towards (v1_x, v1_y)
# #   * range of motion is entire distance from v2->v1. No need to specify.
# #
# # double sliding doors:
# #   * door panels slide from the centerpoint of v1<->v2 towards v1 and v2
# #
# # single/double telescoping doors:
# #   * common in elevators; same parameters as sliding doors; they just
# #     open/close faster and take up less space inside the wall.
