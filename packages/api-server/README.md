# Setup

Install pipenv

```bash
pip3 install pipenv
```

If not already done so, [bootstrap](../../README.md#bootstrap) the project, you can use
```bash
npm run bootstrap -- packages/api-server
```
to bootstrap only this package.

# Run the server

```bash
rmf_api_server
```

## Configuration

Config files are python modules that export a variable named `config`. See [default_config.py](api_server/default_config.py) for an example and list of the options available. All options are REQUIRED unless specified otherwise.

Configuration is read from the file specified in the env `RMF_API_SERVER_CONFIG`, if not provided, the default config is used.

e.g.
```bash
RMF_API_SERVER_CONFIG='my_config.py' rmf_api_server
```

## Supported databases

rmf-server uses [tortoise-orm](https://github.com/tortoise/tortoise-orm/) to perform database operations. Currently, the supported databases are

* PostgreSQL
* SQLite
* MySQL
* MariaDB

by default it uses a in-memory sqlite instance, to use other databases, install rmf-server with the relevalent extras

* PostgreSQL - postgres
* MySQL - mysql
* MariaDB - maria

.e.g.

```bash
pip3 install rmf-server[postgres]
```

Then in your config, set the `db_url` accordingly, the url should be in the form

```
DB_TYPE://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DB_NAME?PARAM1=value&PARAM2=value
```

for example, to connect to postgres

```
postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>/<database>
```

for more information, see https://tortoise-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/databases.html.

## Running behind a proxy

When running behind a reverse proxy like nginx, you need to set the `public_url` option to the url where rmf-server is served on. The reverse proxy also MUST strip the prefix.

For example, if rmf-server is served on https://example.com/rmf/api/v1, `public_url` must be set to `https://example.com/rmf/api/v1` and your reverse proxy must be configured to strip the prefix such that it forwards requests from `/rmf/api/v1/something` to `/something`.

## Running with RMF simulations

When running with rmf simulations, you need to set the env `RMF_SERVER_USE_SIM_TIME=true`. This is needed to ensure that times from the client are correctly converted to RMF's simulation time.
